        <li>He hates loud noises that come from fireworks, thunderstorms and helicopter as they scare him</li>

        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>I wash my dog at home because i prefer to and it gives us enough time to bond which i love. He doesn't fancy a bath so i'll be chasing him when he discovers its bath time but once we get started he does not mind it at all.</p>
        <p>Here are some of my grooming habits</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I trim his nails when i notice they've become to long</li>
          <li>I use shampoo and conditioner that isn't harsh to wash him and sometimes a tick and flea medicine</li>
          <li>I clean his ears regularly though he doesnt like it</li>
          <li>I brush his teeth to prevent dental issues</li>
          <li>I brush his fur and trim it once in a while because he sheds alot</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>As much as i love to groom him at home, I take him to the vet every 3-6months to ensure his health is okay and he is free of ticks</em></p>
